## 📒 Noted  

Hey there! 👋 This is my first project, where I built a **note app** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It helps you track **notes, tasks, and books** all in one place.  

## 🚀 How to Get Started  
1. **Open the app** – Just launch `index.html`.  
2. **Log in** – You can create your own profile or use the default login:  
   - **Username:** `admin123`  
   - **Password:** `admin123`  

## 📝 Main Features  
- **Add Notes, Tasks, and Books** – Each with a **title, date, and description**.  
- **Book tracking** – Keep track of your reading progress.  
- **Built-in Music Player** – Play some tunes while working. 🎶  
- **Sidebar Menu** (right side of the page) with:  
  - ⏰ **Clock** – So you don’t lose track of time.  
  - 🔧 **Settings** – Customize your experience.  
  - ℹ️ **About Us** – A quick link to my GitHub profile.  
  - 🚪 **Logout** – Logs you out and takes you back to the login page.  

## 🏷️ Profile Management  
- Upload or change your profile picture.  
- Remove your picture (it will reset to the default one).  
- Delete all your data if needed.  

## ⚙️ Settings  
- Change the background color of the main page.  
- Disable **Tasks** and/or **Books** if you don’t need them.  

## Easter Egg
- An Easter egg is hidden for you to discover. If you find it, answer a question about the series 'Porodično blago' to claim your reward. Good luck!
